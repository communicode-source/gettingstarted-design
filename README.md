# Communicode Design

A list of resources along with Communicode design files to help jumpstart the design process. In this repository, you'll find Logos, icons, Images, and CSS for Communicode in its current state. Below you'll find a few resources to help you learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 


## Learn HTML and CSS

Codecademy is your definite best bet on this one. Create an account, then take the HTML/CSS course they offer.

After you complete the HTML/CSS course, do the "Create a Website from scratch". This uses bootstrap, an amazing front-end responsive framework that we will be using.

Feel free to work more with codecademy beyond these if you would like, it's a great resource to have. 


To be completely honest, these two courses cover the blunt of what you guys will be working with. Those two will take a good amount of time, so I will stick with just those for now. I will update this periodically with more articles and such, but for now, that should cover it. 

Best of luck to you all.
